     <h2>The Tecknet BM307 Wireless Mouse</h2>
 
        <p class="hardware">
          I have this mouse and use It everyday - includiong right now as I navigate this module. this mouse has a six button design 
          (right & left, back & forward, scroll and DPI button), It makes navigating on my laptop so much easier and without it game play would be impossible.
          One feature that works surprisingly well on this mouse is the DPI button, You can really crank this mouse up where even the slightest 
          movement will send the cursor flying across the display, I have It dialed in pretty slow though. Another cool feature on this mouse is the 
          Intelegent power saving (IPS) function; If the mouse is un-active for more than 10 seconds it'll drop into a power saving mode and if left longer it'll shut off, 
          all you have to do to turn it back on is the right or left button. 
        </p>
        <p class="hardware">
          With It's tru-wave motion senser allowing It to be used on any smooth surface and It's compact design (plus It's low price of $15) It can be anyones best friend.
        </p>

    <h2>The JBL Flip 5 Portable Blue-tooth Speaker</h2>

      <p class="hardware">
        The best friend to any music loving adventurer. With up to 12 hours of playtime and the ipx7 water proof design the possibilities are endless.
        Typical for a JBL speaker, the widely available Flip 5 comes in a collection of colors, including Desert Sand, Mustard Yellow, Dusty Pink,Grey Stone,
        River Teal, Fiesta Red, Ocean Blue, Midnight Black, Steel White and Forest Green. Whichever finish takes your fancy, you get the same straight up,
        no-frills portable speaker. There’s Bluetooth playback of course (simply press the dedicated button to initiate pairing). JBL’s PartyBoost function
        that pairs Flip 5 or Pulse 4 speakers either for stereo pairing or simultaneous playback in the companion the JBL Connect app.
      </p>
      <p class="hardware">
        I got this as a gift a year ago and I've already gotten a ton of use out of it. It's ipx7 covering means I can use it in the shower and It's great to
        take on river floats over the summer. For a hundred dollar speaker the sound is surprisingly good. I would definitely buy it agian.

   <h2>LaCie Rugged SSD</h2>

    <p class="hardware">
      I have loved this this product ever since I was a boy going on adventures in Alaska's Chugach national forest with my photographer father-in-law. 
      He was one of those who had all the latest in tech innovations and the one who got me interested in LaCie's rugged design. I've been a loyal customer ever since.
    </p>
    <p class="hardware">
      In recent years LaCie has come out with some really amazing designs: The Rugged SSD Pro's IP67 ingress protection rating means dust-tight—and able to survive a 30-minute 
      immersion in shallow water. and the waterproofing doesn't rely on whether you remembered to close a flap over the Thunderbolt 3 port. The connector itself is water-resistant.
    </p>
    <p class="hardware">
      And when it comes to speed, the Pro fuses the Seagate FireCuda NVMe SSD with a Thunderbolt 3 interface, making it 5× faster than traditional SATA SSDs (according to LaCie); 
      I for one have no need for such performance, however I still enjoy the security that comse with such a "Rugged" external SSD.
    </p>
